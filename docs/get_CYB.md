# How to get CYB tokens

Cyberd is not in the mainnet yet, so there's no straight forward way to get CYB tokens now. Nevertheless, you could participate in the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) during `euler-6` to gain some CYB right in the Genesis.

You could also go ahead and [run a validator](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/master/docs/run_validator.md) to get more reward.
