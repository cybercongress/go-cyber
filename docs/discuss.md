/// A file contain a list for discussion during research around cyberd. If some useful considerations sparks around some points an issue with tag discussion must be created.

# Discussion topics

- User has tokens (power of linking) and reputation which equal sum of link's weights created/connected to their Q/A.

- reputation vesting ~ inflation <- function *

- link weight ~ reputation <- function *

- broadband ~ reputation <- function *

- link weight applying with quadratic voting

- Retire CID in favor for DURI user defined domain registries

- Discussion on anonimity, complexity of a protocol and expensiveness of computation

- Discuss decay of links with time

- language incentivization bias_. In the core of cyberd is quadratic voting. The system needs it to effectively incentivize participants for quality ranking. But that natively leads to weak incentives across different language groups. E.g blockchain Golos was deployed as Russian alternative to Steem because Russian posts acquired only 0.2% of rewards though providing 10% of the content. The idea of deploying cyberd is great if it can be truly global from the start. The only way to overcome this bias is a global deployment from day 0, because otherwise we need significantly increase the complexity of the reward system. We offer good incentives for translation of this white paper to 50 languages worldwide as well as call for action to all blockchain communities across the globe.

- burning of CYBER in order to increase the rank
A conventional advertiser is also has a tool to participate. Any link can be promoted thus increasing cyber•rank. Revenue from the promotion is burning thus decreasing the supply of CYBER and bringing value to all shareholders of a system. We do believe that this approach is fair and don't harm user experience but open opportunity to compete with conventional search ad a bit.

- incentivization of developers. As our primary focus is developers of decentralized and distributed applications we offer a convenient way of revenue generation in addition to possible revenue on dynamic snippets development. Every search and answer transaction can define a smart contract with up to 6 beneficiaries with a distribution of potential reward from this particular action. This creates a solid foundation for bootstrapping application ecosystem across a conventional web, mobile app stores and upcoming VR platforms.

- idea: split reward pool in accordance to relevance of terms.

- Priorities for learning the beast: Arxiv, Chains, Wiki, Github, Bittorent, IPFS

- we cannot make distributions based on the history of ranking object because we decide to reject an idea of storing the historical state due to tremendous costs.
