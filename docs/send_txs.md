# Your First Cyber-js Actions - Send Tokens

<HighlightBox type="learning">

Take your first steps with cyber-js. Use it to send some simple transactions.
<br></br>
In this section, you will:

* Download and install cyber-js.
* Create a small experiment.
* Testnet preparation
* Establish your connection.
* Inspect a balance.
* Send transactions.

</HighlightBox>

A basic feature of a Bostrom chain is the ability to send tokens via the `bank` module. Cyber-js naturally offers functions to cover this facility. You are going to:

1. Use an existing test network (testnet) with a key of your own.
2. Run basic Cyber-js commands in a script that you run using the CLI.

Additionally, you can choose to:

1. Start a local chain that exposes RPCs instead of using a testnet.
2. Run the same basic Cyber-js commands, but for this local chain.

Along the way, you learn the basic Cyber-js concepts needed to start interacting with the Cosmos Ecosystem.

## Script preparation

A small, ready-made repository exists so you can experiment with Cyber-js. Clone it from here. You need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you open the folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), the IDE should give you all the coding help you require. In the cloned folder you need to install the required modules:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Create a new file named `experiment.ts`. In it, put these lines to confirm it works:

```typescript
const runAll = async(): Promise<void> => {
    console.log("TODO")
}

runAll()
```

To execute, this TypeScript file needs to be compiled into JavaScript before being interpreted by NodeJs. Add this as a run target in `package.json`:

```json
...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "experiment": "ts-node experiment.ts"
    }
...
```

Confirm that it does what you want:

```sh
$ npm run experiment
```

This returns:

```
> ts-node experiment.ts

TODO
```

You will soon make this script more meaningful. With the basic script ready, you need to prepare some elements.

## Testnet preparation

The Bostrom has a number of testnets running. The Bostrom is currently running a [public testnet](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernode) for the Space-pussy-1 upgrade that you are connecting to and running your script on. You need to connect to a public node so that you can query information and broadcast transactions. One of the available nodes is:

```
RPC: https://rpc.space-pussy-1.cybernode.ai
```

You need a wallet address on the testnet and you must create a 24-word mnemonic in order to do so. CosmJS can generate one for you. Create a new file `generate_mnemonic.ts` with the following script:

```typescript
import { DirectSecp256k1HdWallet } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing"

const generateKey = async (): Promise<void> => {
    const wallet: DirectSecp256k1HdWallet = await DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.generate(24)
    process.stdout.write(wallet.mnemonic)
    const accounts = await wallet.getAccounts()
    console.error("Mnemonic with 1st account:", accounts[0].address)
}

generateKey()
```

Now create a **key** for our imaginary user **Alice**:

*Note: You likely need to update Node.js to a later version if this fails. Find a guide [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version).

```sh
$ npx ts-node generate_mnemonic.ts > testnet.alice.mnemonic.key
```

When done, it should also tell you the address of the first account:

```
Mnemonic with 1st account: bostrom1sw8xv3mv2n4xfv6rlpzsevusyzzg78r3e78xnp
```

Temporarily keep this address for convenience, although CosmJS can always recalculate it from the mnemonic. Privately examine the file to confirm it contains your 24 words.

<HighlightBox type="warn">

Important considerations:

1. `process.stdout.write` was used to avoid any line return. Be careful not to add any empty lines or any other character in your `.key` file (this occurs with VSCode under certain conditions). If you add any characters, ComsJs may not be able to parse it.
2. Adjust the `.gitignore` file to not commit your `.key` file by mistake:

    ```
    node_modules
    *.key
    ```

<!-- <HighlightBox type="tip">

For your convenience, we have a branch available [here](https://github.com/b9lab/cosmjs-sandbox/tree/file-preparation) that contains all the code and files you've added so far.

</HighlightBox> -->

## Add your imports

You need a small, simple interface to a blockchain, one which could eventually have users. Good practice is to refrain from requesting a user address until necessary (e.g. when a user clicks a relevant button). Therefore, in `experiment.ts` you first use the read-only client. Import it at the top of the file:

```typescript
import { CyberClient } from "@cybercongress/cyber-js"
```

<HighlightBox type="info">

Note that VSCode assists you to auto-complete [`CyberClient`](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/cyberclient.ts#L144) if you type <kbd>CTRL-Space</kbd> inside the `{}` of the `import` line.

</HighlightBox>

## Define your connection

Next, you need to tell the client how to connect to the RPC port of your blockchain:

```typescript
const rpc = "https://rpc.space-pussy-1.cybernode.ai"
```

Inside the `runAll` function you [initialize the connection](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/cyberclient.ts#L165) and immediately [check](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/cyberclient.ts#L244) you connected to the right place:

```typescript
const runAll = async(): Promise<void> => {
    const client = await CyberClient.connect(rpc)
    console.log("With client, chain id:", await client.getChainId(), ", height:", await client.getHeight())
}
```

Run again to check with `npm run experiment`, and you get:

```
With client, chain id: space-pussy-1 , height: 9507032
```

## Get a balance

Normally you would not yet have access to your user's address. However, for this exercise you need to know how many tokens Alice has, so add a temporary new command inside `runAll`:

```typescript
console.log(
    "Alice balances:",
    await client.getAllBalances("bostrom1sw8xv3mv2n4xfv6rlpzsevusyzzg78r3e78xnp"), // <-- replace with your generated address
)
```

`getAllBalances` is used because the default token name is not yet known. When you run it again, you get:

```
Alice balances: []
```

If you just created this account, Alice's balance is zero. Alice needs tokens to be able to send transactions and participate in the network. A common practice with testnets is to expose **faucets** (services that send you test tokens for free, within limits).

Request tokens for Alice by entering this command in command line:

```sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"denom":"boot","address":"bostrom1sw8xv3mv2n4xfv6rlpzsevusyzzg78r3e78xnp"}' https://space-pussy-1.cybernode.ai/credit
```

Check that Alice received the tokens with `npm run experiment`.

## Prepare a signing client

If you go through the methods inside [`CyberClient`](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/cyberclient.ts#L144), you see that it only contains query-type methods and none for sending transactions.

Now, for Alice to send transactions, she needs to be able to sign them. And to be able to sign transactions, she needs access to her _private keys_ or _mnemonics_. Or rather she needs a client that has access to those. That is where [`SigningCyberClient`](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/signingcyberclient.ts#L239) comes in. Conveniently, `SigningCyberClient` inherits from `CyberClient`.

Update your import line:

```typescript
import { SigningCyberClient, CyberClient } from "@cybercongress/cyber-js"
```

Look at its declaration by right-clicking on the `SigningCyberClient` in your imports and choosing <kbd>Go to Definition</kbd>.

When you instantiate `SigningCyberClient` by using the [`connectWithSigner`](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/signingcyberclient.ts#L247) method, you need to pass it a [**signer**](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/signingcyberclient.ts#L249). In this case, use the [`OfflineDirectSigner`](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/signingcyberclient.ts#L29) interface.

<HighlightBox type="info">

The recommended way to encode messages is by using `OfflineDirectSigner`, which uses Protobuf. However, hardware wallets such as Ledger do not support this and still require the legacy Amino encoder. If your app requires Amino support, you have to use the `OfflineAminoSigner`.
<br></br>
Read more about encoding [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/core/encoding.html).

</HighlightBox>

The signer needs access to Alice's **private key**, and there are several ways to accomplish this. In this example, use Alice's saved **mnemonic**. To load the mnemonic as text in your code you need this import:

```typescript
import { readFile } from "fs/promises"
```

There are several implementations of `OfflineDirectSigner` available. The [`DirectSecp256k1HdWallet`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/0f0c9d8/packages/proto-signing/src/directsecp256k1hdwallet.ts#L133) implementation is most relevant to us due to its [`fromMnemonic`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/0f0c9d8/packages/proto-signing/src/directsecp256k1hdwallet.ts#L140-L141) method. Add the import:

```typescript
import { DirectSecp256k1HdWallet, OfflineDirectSigner } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing"
```

The `fromMnemonic` factory function needs a string with the mnemonic. You read this string from the mnemonic file. Create a new top-level function that returns an `OfflineDirectSigner`:

```typescript [https://github.com/b9lab/cosmjs-sandbox/blob/4168b97/experiment.ts#L9-L13]
const getAliceSignerFromMnemonic = async (): Promise<OfflineDirectSigner> => {
    return DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic((await readFile("./testnet.alice.mnemonic.key")).toString(), {
        prefix: "bostrom",
    })
}

```

The Bostrom Testnet uses the `bostrom` address prefix. This is the default used by `DirectSecp256k1HdWallet`, but you are encouraged to explicitly define it as you might be working with different prefixes on different blockchains. In your `runAll` function, add:

```typescript
const aliceSigner: OfflineDirectSigner = await getAliceSignerFromMnemonic()
```

As a first step, confirm that it recovers Alice's address as expected:

```typescript
const alice = (await aliceSigner.getAccounts())[0].address
console.log("Alice's address from signer", alice)
```

Now add the line that finally creates the signing client:

```typescript
const signingClient = await SigningCyberClient.connectWithSigner(rpc, aliceSigner)
```

Check that it works like the read-only client that you used earlier, and from which [it inherits](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/signingcyberclient.ts#L239), by adding:

```typescript
console.log(
    "With signing client, chain id:",
    await signingClient.getChainId(),
    ", height:",
    await signingClient.getHeight()
)
```

## Send tokens

Alice can now send some tokens to Bob, but to do so she also needs to pay the network's gas fee. How much gas should she use, and at what price?

She can copy this:

```
Gas fee: [ { denom: 'boot', amount: '0' } ]
Gas limit: 200000
```

With the gas information now decided, how does Alice structure her command so that she sends tokens to Bob ? `SigningCyberClient`'s [`sendTokens`](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/signingcyberclient.ts#L604) function takes a `Coin[]` as input. `Coin` is simply defined as:

```typescript
export interface Coin {
    denom: string;
    amount: string;
}
```

Alice can pick any `denom` and any `amount` as long as she owns them, the signing client signs the transaction and broadcasts it. In this case it is:

```typescript
{ denom: "boot", amount: "1" }
```

With this gas and coin information, add the command:

```typescript [https://github.com/b9lab/cosmjs-sandbox/blob/2c7b137/experiment.ts#L57-L63]
// Check the balance of Alice and the Faucet
console.log("Alice balance before:", await client.getAllBalances(alice))
console.log("Bob balance before:", await client.getAllBalances(bobAddress))
// Execute the sendTokens Tx and store the result
const result = await signingClient.sendTokens(
    alice,
    bobAddress,
    [{ denom: "boot", amount: "1" }],
    {
        amount: [{ denom: "boot", amount: "0" }],
        gas: "200000",
    },
)
// Output the result of the Tx
console.log("Transfer result:", result)
```

Run this with `npm run experiment` and you should get:

```
...
Transfer result: {
  code: 0,
  height: 0,
  rawLog: '[]',
  transactionHash: '104BFAB101D8EB88C14D7EFCF50F96F29DA02C7DD85C70FAAB1D96D41C2FA04E',
  gasUsed: 0,
  gasWanted: 0
}
```
Check that Alice sended the tokens with [`getTx`](https://github.com/cybercongress/soft3.js/blob/main/src/cyberclient.ts#L314)

```typescript
const result = await client.getTx("104BFAB101D8EB88C14D7EFCF50F96F29DA02C7DD85C70FAAB1D96D41C2FA04E")
```


This concludes your first use of cyber-js to send tokens.
